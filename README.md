# IDProductionSystem

Web-based application for Printing IDs of employees. 

## What I learned:
1. Upgrade from select2 JS library to [Selective JS](https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/)
2. Added [DOMPDF Wrapper for Laravel ](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-dompdf) to this project for printing montly accomplishment summary.
3. Used [Winbox JS](https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/) for previewing ID before printing.
